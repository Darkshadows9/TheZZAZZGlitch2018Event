These are all of my notes related to TheZZAZZGlitch's 2018 April Fools event. This includes a full walkthrough with some technical writings and a world map. I would suggest starting in either place, though you may be interested in the reverse-engineered algorithm in CC3.

The walkthrough/technical writings are in the .odt format. I suggest using Libre Office to open it.
